## Structure
There are two main folders in this repo, `Notebook` and `package`. In the `package` we implmented our method as a python package `SBIRR` to be installed. After installation one can run experiments in `Notebook`

## Experiments
Experiments using our method is written in noteboos in `Notebooks` folder, with name of each notebook being the experimental dataset. All cleaned data is in `Notebooks/data`
